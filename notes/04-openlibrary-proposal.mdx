Hi! I want to contribute to brid.gy and add an integration with OpenLibrary.

Would be great to get notifications about the books I read, and since Goodreads deprecated their API,
the best option could be the [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/).

The easiest option is to start from the listening part. They do not have any oAuth options right now,
but API is available for GET option: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

So what I think:

**Login**

After you login into Brid.gy with your website (indie auth), check profile page from OpenLibrary (OL) that you added to the input.
for instance, https://openlibrary.org/people/zpetspey is my OL account, and it has my site https://yepstepz.io,
and I can add

```html
    ...
    <a href="https://openlibrary.org/people/zpetspey" rel="me"></a>
    ...
```

to my site. It would be enough to show that I want to listen some updates.

**Updates**

There are a few pages that I would possibly crawl to get my updates from:

- `currently-reading`
- `read`
- `would like to read`

Bridgy could crawl it from time to time to get updates.

I don't see any eTag on curl -I request, but probably once in a day is ok.

Another interesting feature request could be to fetch `year's goal` and `stats`.
Would be nice to get that updates from webmention.

**Post**

After crawling and getting updates, bridgy could form a post.
There is a discussion about some properties here: https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/10,
so I need to research it further.

What do you think? I also have plans for investigating posting possibility, but wanted to check if this idea is ok with you.
