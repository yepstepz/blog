Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

This is a youtube video:

<iframe width="100%" style={{ minHeight: 450 }} src="//www.youtube.com/embed/82BGa-kkAAo?list=UUH9ciCUcWavMsFcAJtLUSyw" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<div>111</div>

Importantly, Next.js let's you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
